- I moved the development [here](https://github.com/UNICT-DMI/unict-telegram-hub)
- A live demo is available [here](https://telegram.unictdev.org/)

## What's the purpose?

This web application shows all telegram channels linked to the University of Catania(UNICT).<br />
It also shows each telegram group associated with each subject of UNICT's Computer Science study course.

## You just cloned the repository, what to do next?

First of all, you should download and install Node.js from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Then you should open a CLI and move into the project directory. Once you've done that you should get all the necessary dependencies by running the following command: `npm install`.

## Basic commands

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
